% Pandoc uses its own really big LaTeX template, and this is
% a bit difficult to modify. To keep things clear for this project
% we'll just have Pandoc run our setup for us from this file after
% it's finished its usual setup.
% See the command line arguments passed to Pandoc to learn how this
% is done with `-header-includes='\input{template/capstone_template.tex}'`.
% If you want to see the template and have Pandoc installed you can
% run the command `pandoc --print-default-template=latex`.

% \documentclass[a4paper]{article}	% you'll find this in the Pandoc invocation arguments instead
